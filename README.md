# PostApe-Fishstick [Generic Mockup]
A mock-up of watered-down mockup of the Mailchimp website. Designed to be as generic as possible. Started on 06/25/2023.

## Description
As a practice project, the goal is to get familiar with the coding languages used in 2023 web development.
These are the languages / frameworks that are being practiced with the project:
* Frontend
    * React [Material-UI]
    * Figma
* Backend
    * N / A

## Inspiration
Resources that helped me to build / inspire the design of the practice project.
Kept for future reference.
